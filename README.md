# UFO


#### Background:

Dana is a data journalist from McMinnville, Oregon. The town is famous for UFO sightings. She has a keen interest in UFOs and was given an opportunity to investigate and write about the UFO sightings. The data she analysed was in a Javascript file which she published to a webpage displaying the data in a table format.

#### Overview of the analysis:

Currently, Dana's website only allows you to filter the table by only one search criteria (date) which is inputted by the user. Dana's objective is to further refine the filter search function to allow for additional search criterias such as city, state, country and shape. By allowing users to filter by multiple search criterias, it will allow for a more in-depth analysis.

#### Results:

Dana's webpage is fully functioning now.

Follow the steps below to perform a search:
